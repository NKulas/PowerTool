# PowerTool
<h2>Description</h2>
This utility allows for performing various actions on a remote computer in a Windows Active Directory domain environment. The "Interface" file is the main entry point. It will call additional modules in the "Modules" folder to perform each action.
<h2>Background</h2>
I began this project in my free time at work to teach myself Powershell. I have a lot of cool modules, and am working on removing information specific to my workplace in order to make them usable on any domain.
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the files and put them in a directory of your choice</li>
<li>Open "Configuration->DomainName" and replace the text with your fully qualified domain name</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: Open the directory in file explorer, right click on the "Interface.ps1" file, and select run with Powershell</li>
<li>Option 2: Open the Powershell prompt, enter "cd" followed by the path to the directory the files are in, enter ".\Interface.ps1"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cautions</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have only tested this with computers in a Windows Active Directory domain. I do not know what the results of using it on a computer that is not part of a domain would be.</li>
<li>If you get an error about permission denied, you will have to follow usage option 2, but open the Powershell prompt with the "Run as Administrator" option.</li>
</ul>
